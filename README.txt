HOW TO RUN THE Code:

 (1) Place hourly observed sea level data (station name.csv) in the Input folder (e.g., Battery.csv, Boston.csv)  

 (2) Run Daily_WaterLevel_Data.m after inserting the station name. The mean and maximum daily values will be saved as an excel file in the Inputs folder.
     (e.g.,Battery_DailyWaterLevel.xlsx, Boston_DailyWaterLevel.xlsx )

 (3) Run Run_Mixture_Model.m after inserting Minor and major flood threshold and the desired return periods. 
     If the mean and maximum daily values have already been created, skip steps (1) and (2). 

  ** The hourly and daily sea level data  are available for 4 Stations in the Inputs folder as examples (e.g., Battery, Boston, Grand Isle and San Francisco)
